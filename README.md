### Twilio SendGrid 101: An Introduction to Sending Transactional Email

Among the communication channels available today, email is non-negotiable. Email is reliable, works globally, and offers flexibility that can't be met by other communications avenues. In this workshop, you'll learn how to implement the Twilio SendGrid Mail Send API to programmatically deliver email at scale. You'll also see how the Twilio SendGrid dynamic templating system makes it possible to personalize your messages for each customer, and you can expect some deliverability pro-tips along the way.

### Scaling Messaging

The Message API will get you very far, but when it comes to scale, it's helpful to take a step back and think through some best practices. In this talk we'll walk through things you should consider, and provide guidance for how you can take your applications to the next level.

### Scaling with Segment

You may ask yourself – what does a CDP have to do with developers? It’s pretty simple – you get to spend less time managing ETLs, and more time focusing on core products and customer experiences. Join us for a Superclass to explore how Segment can help support your engineering organization as it scales - ultimately lowering costs with first-party data your teams can trust.
